ASSIGNMENT 6
Part A
Please find your assignment for today
Create a process management utility, to find
Top n process by memory
Top n process by cpu
Kill process having least priority
running duration of a process by name or pid
List orphan process if any
List zoombie process if any
Kill process by name or pid
List process that are waiting for the resources
i.e.
./ otProcessManager topProcess 5 memory
./ otProcessManager topProcess 10 cpu
./ otProcessManager killLeastPriorityProcess 
./ otProcessManager RunningDurationProcess <processName>/<processID>
./ otProcessManager listOrphanProcess
./ otProcessManager listZoombieProcess
./ otProcessManager killProcess <processName>/<processID>
./ otProcessManager ListWaitingProcess

Part B
Process Manager utility
Create a ProcessManager utility that will perform below operation:
register a service which it will start as a daemon service( it will register script path and one alias to this service)
start a particular service
show the status of particular service(shows whether a service is running or not)
stop a particular service
change the priority of any service
list the details of particular service started by this utility
 i.e.
./ProcessManager.sh -o register -s <path> -a <alias> -> Register Process
./ProcessManager.sh -o start -a <alias> -> Start Process
./ProcessManager.sh -o status  -a <alias> -> status of  processes
./ProcessManager.sh -o kill -a <alias> -> Kill process
./ProcessManager.sh -o priority -p <low/med/high> -a <alias> -> change priority
./ProcessManager.sh -o list  
output:
service2
service1
service3
./ProcessManager.sh -o top [-a <alias>] -> List process details
output:
 alias, PID, State, Priority, Script

Part C
Let's play around with process:
clear a log file of running process
delete a log file of running process and see what happens to process
elevate the priority of a process
